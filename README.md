# Braking_systems
Utility MATLAB scripts that I used when working on the braking system of the Formula Student race car from Squadra Corse Polito, in 2018, and when writing my MSc thesis, in 2019

# Stable release
This is the first release of some of the scripts that I used when writing my MSc thesis. I am publishing the ones that could be useful to other students facing the design of a braking system.

I have organized and formatted the code so that others (and myself) can understand what they do and perhaps use them later.

There are two sets of scripts:

## Brake rotor convection study
This can be used in preliminary design to evaluate the thermal properties of the brake disc. This is by no means a precise design tool: the scripts are useful to get insights into the thermal response of the brake discs.

### Single-stop temperature rise

### Simulated temperature during continuous braking

## Brake load repartition study
Evaluate the distribution of braking forces in the front and rear axle in ideal conditions, and compare with the system response, based on the vehicle data (mass, geometry, hydraulic system components)

### Ideal brake force repartition
